## Daily/Weekly/Monthly Reports & Challenge Badges
The Spending Trends Graphs feature provides users with a visual representation of their spending patterns over time, either by week or month. This feature includes two graphs to help users visualize their spending habits. The bar chart represents the user's weekly spending, providing an easy-to-read breakdown of daily expenditures. The pie chart summarizes the user's monthly expenditures, categorizing spending into key areas such as Shopping, Food, Travel, Utilities, and other essential categories. 
The Savings Challenge Badges feature introduces a gamified aspect to the user’s saving journey. Users are rewarded with badges as they reach specific savings milestones, such as "Save 10," "Save 20," and "Save 40." These badges are displayed on the dashboard, with each completed badge represented by a checkmark next to the corresponding milestone. By offering a sense of achievement through this challenge system, the feature makes saving money more engaging and encourages long-term financial discipline.

## Categorize Expenses

- This feature will allow users to add their expenses and categorize them into categories such as food, travel, shopping, and more. When adding a new expense, users would need to add a label, the amount, and the category they choose for the expenditure. This categorization helps users sort their expenses better and preview them easily from the logs tab. This provides a clearer view of the user's spending habits and allows them to manage areas of spending effectively. The categories created will also help with the pie charts and graphs on the dashboard for spending analytics. Users can also personalize the label of the expense. On the logs tab, users can filter through their expenses based on the date added, label, amount, or category, making it easy to view their spending history. It directly addresses the problem of users feeling overwhelmed to track expenses as it organizes expenses in a meaningful and personalized way.

## Expense Reduction Suggestions/Tips (3 points)

- The tips feature is a resource for users to go if they are looking for advice on how to BudgetBetter. It first suggests two areas where the user can reduce spending, their biggest individual purchase and their biggest expense category. This way they can get a small summary of what they may need to change about their spending for these areas. Then there are 3 tips which are generated on a weekly basis (or force generated by the user) these tips come from an array of statements which apply to saving money as well as user-generated tips they may have thought of personal to them. This leads us to it's next implementation which is a section to "add to the tip jar" here a user can submit a more personalized tip like "Dunkin' only once a week" which they will see at random times in their weekly tips. Last is the Financial influencers side bar which features 3 different finance influencers and their social media pages which can give the user more places to look for different types of financial advice.
